# Experience

## Architectural Co-op: BDCL Architects — 2020

I designed a new web presence for an architecture firm specializing in affordable housing. Long-term maintainability by non-technical people was a hard requirement, so Squarespace was used, with custom CSS and JavaScript added only where necessary.

## Architectural Co-op: Childress & Cunningham Architects — 2016

I provided design and drafting support on a variety of projects. Notably, I provided a full schematic design for an entry plaza that doubled as an ADA-compliant accessible ramp for a small-town government building.

## Architectural Co-op: Eckenhoff Saunders Architects — 2015

I managed the materials library at a mid-size Chicago architecture firm.

## Rueve Group — 2017-2019

I performed design and fabrication for an extensive remodel of a late-19th-century townhouse, including kitchen, flooring, plumbing, and electrical work.

## Metro Scooter — 2008-2014

I worked at Metro Scooter for years as a generalist. I educated customers on the sales floor, produced graphical and written marketing assets, and honed my debugging skills in the mechanic’s shop.

## Parkers Press — 2012-2014

Part-time, I developed a screen-printing business. I developed a streamlined printing process that required more upfront design effort than a typical workflow, but enabled me to produce a higher-quality product with less investment in tooling and labor.
